# WebView2CSharpBrowser
An adaptation of Microsoft's C++ WebViewBrowserApp


This is my attempt to make a C# example of Microsoft's [Github WebViewBrowserApp](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Browser).

I have one known issue which I think has more to do with WPF than WebView2.  Would love for someone to work out how to fix it.
